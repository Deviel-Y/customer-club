# Customer Club

Customer Club is a full-stack application built with Next.js, designed to manage invoice issuance, proforma invoices with expiration dates, and ticket assignments between customers and admins. This project is not a typical e-commerce store but a specialized platform for managing invoicing, notifications, and communication between customers and admins in an organized, user-friendly way.

## Features

- **Invoice & Proforma Invoice Management**: Admins can create, update, delete, and archive invoices and proforma invoices. Archived invoices can be restored within a specific date range.
- **Ticketing System**: Customers can create tickets and assign them to admins, enabling a direct line of communication.
- **Notification System**: Alerts both customers and admins of important events and updates.
- **Logging System**: SuperAdmin users can access a log system that records activities for all users on the platform.

## Tech Stack

The project is powered by the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, NextUI, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Prisma, NextAuth (for authentication)
- **Utilities**: Axios, Zod, React Hook Form, Moment-jalaali, Sharp, Date-fns, and bcrypt (for hashing)
